================


This is a simple one player pong game built as a Windows Game on Visual Studio using the XNA 4.0 Runtime Environment.
The goal of the game is to prevent the ball from hitting the ground by hitting it with the "paddle". The more
times you successfully hit the ball, the faster the speed of the ball will get. Finally, if the ball does hit the ground
it will be reset to its original position (top of the screen) with its original speed.
